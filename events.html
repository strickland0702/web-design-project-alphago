                    <div>
                        <p>In October 2015, AlphaGo played its first match against the reigning three-time European Champion, Mr Fan Hui. AlphaGo won the first ever game against a Go professional with a score of 5-0. Before the match, Fan Hui thought he would win easily, but in the end he was badly beaten. This is the beginning of the miracle. </p>

                        AlphaGo's way is not to make territory here or there, but to place every stone in a position where it will be most useful. This is the true theory of Go.

                    <h2>Match Against 18-times World Champion Lee Sedol</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>AlphaGo then competed against legendary Go player Mr Lee Sedol, the winner of 18 world titles, who is widely considered the greatest player of the past decade. AlphaGo's 4-1 victory in Seoul, South Korea, on March 2016 was watched by over 200 million people worldwide. This landmark achievement was a decade ahead of its time. </p>
                        <p>The game earned AlphaGo a 9 dan professional ranking, the highest certification. This was the first time a computer Go player had ever received the accolade. During the games, AlphaGo played several inventive winning moves, several of which - including move 37 in game two - were so surprising that they upended hundreds of years of wisdom. Players of all levels have extensively examined these moves ever since.</p>

                        There was a cut that quite shocked me, because it was a move that would never happen in a human-to-human Go match. But, afterwards I analyzed the move and I found that it was very good. It is one move with two or even more purposes. We call it one stone, two birds.

                    <h2>The Chinese Summit</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>In May 2017 Deepmind teamed up with the world’s best Go players for The Future of Go Summit - a five day festival of Go and artificial intelligence in the game's birthplace, China - to uncover yet more secrets of this ancient game. A variety of game formats have been designed to unearth even more new strategies - including pair Go, team Go, and a 1:1 match with the world’s number one player Ke Jie.  It won against Ke Jie to clinch a second, decisive win of a three-part series that is taking place in Wuzhen, China. </p>
