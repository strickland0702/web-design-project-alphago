                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>Go is a board game that originated in ancient China. 
                        Today it is played worldwide but has a particularly strong following in China, Japan and Korea.

                    <h2>Rules of Go</h2>
                    <div>
                        <p>Go is played on a grid with black and white stones. 
                            It is played by two people, each taking turns to place a stone of their color at one of the intersection points on the grid. 
                            Once placed on the board, stones do not move.
                            In order to claim victory, players must coexist on the board with stones of the other color and find a way to surround more points of territory than your opponent.
